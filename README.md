Thesis on understanding the underlying features for the prediction of plant-based N-linked glycosylation through the  application of machine-learning methods, as human-based glycosylation predictors were highly inaccurate. Through dissection of hard to separate data using machine learning,  a model was created for the prediction of glycosylation sites based on experimentally verified glycosites in Arabidopsis thaliana, where it was found that glycosylation sites had a statistically significant topological preference for coils/turns and Î²-sheets.
