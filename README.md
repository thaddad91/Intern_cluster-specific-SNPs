# Intern_cluster-specific-SNPs

As part of the Infectious Diseases Research, Diagnostics and Screening (IDS) bacterial group, I’ve identified and quantified an additional method for robust identification of recent transmission clusters of M. tuberculosis isolates from The Netherlands, using single-nucleotide polymorphisms as cluster-defining markers. This resulted in evidence supporting the robustness and applicability of cluster-defining SNP’s  for potential rapid identification of recent TB transmissions clusters when whole-genome-sequencing would not be readily available.
